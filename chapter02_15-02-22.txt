Observer Pattern: The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when
one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
(alternate definition) The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between a set of objects.
When the state of one object changes, all of its dependents are notified.

- The class responsible for notifying about the change in state is called the Subject.
- The classes waiting for the notification are Observers.
- One Subject can have many Observers.

Design Principals:
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

Questions:
- how to loosely couple the state passed through the update() method of Observer???
